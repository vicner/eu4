Across the Gobi desert, in outer §YMongolia§!, lies the few remnants of Kublai's realm, weak and divided.\n\nNews from the north, however, speak of a new leader who has united the Nomad hordes. §YEsen§! of the §YChoros§! clan have united the §YOirats§! and Mongols and might yet turn his greedy eyes on the Middle Kingdom."

The descendants of Genghis and Kublai Khan are presently rulers of little more than a few disparate Mongolian tribes, and have been subdued by a foreign Khan of much less worthy descent.\n\nWhat the future has in store for the once great §YMongolia§! is far from clear.

Until they come, the people at the edge of the plain are trapped between hostile forests, foreboding mountains, and unforgiving deserts, certain that survival will be a struggle."

For now, they are quiet: the plains are a foreboding obstacle few dare to cross, leaving them beyond the reach of many of their rivals.\nBut with more and more pressure from the east and west pushing the tribes at the edge into the plains, the Pawnee and Wichita's time of peace may soon end..."

At last free of the tyrannical rule of the Ani-Kutani priest cast, the Cherokee, distant relatives of the Iroquoian people to the north, now seek to expand their power over the surrounding regions.\nTo the south, the Coosa chiefdom and its §YCreek§! people still hold considerable sway, and represent the major obstacle to the rising Cherokee power. To the north, the §YShawnee§! and their Algonquian relatives are much weaker, and unless allied together, should present much less of a threat."

Though its power remains strong, it has seen the decline of its neighbors. Its people, who will soon call themselves Mvskoke (or §YCreek§!), are vigilant for rising threats, both in the surrounding land and from the sea to the east.\nThe worst of these threats are doubtlessly the §YCherokee§! to the north, who have claimed many once-great Mound builders cities for their own and who speak an alien language.\nThey would like nothing more than to expand their reach in the southern valleys of the Coosa Chiefdom, and must be stopped at all cost."

Tracing their lineage far to the west, the Chickasha (or §YChickasaw§!) and the Chatah (or §YChoctaw§!) both maintain a strong tribal unity, and though they must be wary of one another, face few other threats.\nBut to the south and east, the sea lies, and none of the Chickasaw or Choctaw people know what lies beyond it.\nCould a threat greater than they have ever faced someday come from across the waves?"
 string_start_denmark:0 "As of the treaty of Kalmar in 1397 the Nordic Crowns of §YNorway§!, §YSweden§! and §YDenmark§! are intended to be borne by one monarch. Since its inception this §YKalmar Union§! has been lead by the Danes, the strongest and richest of the Nordic powers, close to the continent with an ambition to control and dominate the Baltic Sea area.\n\nThe Danish monarchy has many enemies however, in particular among the cities of the §YHanseatic League§!, an alliance of free cities in control of the Baltic trade that Denmark now threatens. This recently culminated in a series of wars ending in the loss of §YSlesvig§! followed by the deposition of the Danish king Erik, now a mere pirate chief on the island of Gotland.\n\nDenmark has just elected a new king from the Bavarian §YWittelsbach§! family. Cristopher has no ties to the Danish or Swedish nobility but it seems he has grand plans for the three Nordic kingdoms, styling himself the first Arch-King of the North.\n\nTime will tell what Christopher's legacy will be. The Danish crown has pawned away many of its assets to its leading families while neither the Swedish or Norwegian nobles seem to care much for their new German king. The Norwegians still favor the deposed Erik, while the Swedish nobility was recently united under their regent, Karl Knutsson."
 string_start_sweden:0 "The Kingdom of §YSweden§! entered the Kalmar Union with §YNorway§! and §YDenmark§! willingly in 1397, eager to limit the influence of the German merchants of the Hanseatic League. The union has however in many ways proved to be a disappointment to the Swedish nobles. Authority has become centered in faraway Denmark, and the many conflicts with §YLübeck§! and the Hanseatic cities have been quite costly. Many are weary of their hard-earned money being spent on Danish adventures in Northern Germany, wars that also disrupt trade and hinder the export of Swedish iron.\n\nTensions reached an all time high in the 1430’s with the popular Engelbrekt rebellion forcibly ejecting Danish officials from the country. An uprising that together with failed wars against the Hanseatic League led to the deposition of the Union King §YErik§!, who has fled to the island of §YGotland§!, leading a life as a local pirate rather than the king of the north.\n\nThe new king elected by Danes, Swedes and Norwegians is a foreigner with no local power base, §YChristopher von Wittelsbach§!, but the real power in the kingdom of Sweden lies with the Lord High Justiciar of Sweden, Karl Knutsson Bonde, and the Swedish nobility.\n\nTime will make it clear if the Union of Kalmar can be mended, or if Sweden will walk its own way. What is clear is that the control over the Baltic Sea and its many estuaries and ports will be imperative to the Swedish Kingdom. The sea routes are what binds the large Swedish kingdom together, from Kalmar to Viborg, and that is also how the bountiful Swedish iron and copper reach the continent.\n\nFor Sweden to achieve such dominion over the Baltics, a Dominium Maris Baltici, it will have to defeat not only German merchants but also get involved in the politics of the §YHoly Roman Empire§!. Not to mention overcoming the §YTeutonic§! and §YLivonian§! Orders and others who are interested in controlling the Baltic trade. The §YRussian§! Principalities, the §YPolish§! and the §YLithuanians§! are all long term natural rivals in this struggle, not to mention the Danish kingdom with which Sweden is currently united..."
 string_start_poland:0 "When Wladyslaw III fell in the battle of Varna both §YPoland§! and §YHungary§! were robbed of their kings in one stroke. Without leadership it is now up to the nobles of the realm to appoint a new ruler. The most natural successor, §YCasimir Jagiellon§!, has been made Grand Duke of §YLithuania§! 4 years prior. Crowning him would, however, require reaching an agreement that is acceptable to both Casimir, the Lithuanian and the Polish nobles.\n\nEver since the 1392 the two states have been bound together by a series of agreements seeking to integrate the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland in order to allow them to present a united front against their common enemies: the Knights of the §YTeutonic§! and §YLivonian Orders§!, the Tatars of the §YGolden Horde§! and the §YCrimean§! Khanate, and the §YRussian§! Principalities, lead by §YMuscovy§! in the north west. This cooperation has allowed the two countries to thrive despite their many enemies, but integrating the nobility of two such divergent states has not been an easy matter. Among both the Polish and the Lithuanian nobility there are some, the Magnates, who control very large estates and command great political influence. These families are in some ways the financial and political backbone of their states, but they are also a power factor that even kings might think twice before rejecting.\n\nWhile large parts of their lands are sparsely populated there is little doubt that Poland and Lithuania could be among the most powerful states in Europe if they go forward with their integration. Their enemies are however quite formidable. In the far south the §YOttoman§! Empire seems to be at the gates of Hungary, ready to expand up the flow of the Danube. To the north the highly militarized Teutonic Order  consider the two states its main enemy. Perhaps most dangerous of them all however, is the Grand Duchy of Muscovy in the far north east. The Muscovites are rapidly creating a strong and expansive state to challenge the Lithuanian overlordship over the Ruthenian and Russian peoples that inhabit most of the Grand Duchy..."
 string_start_france:0 "The Hundred Years War which has torn §YFrance§! apart for over a century is currently halted by a truce following a number of key French victories. With the support of Joan of Arc, since martyred at the hands of the §YEnglish§!, and the support of the rich §YAnjou§! family, §YCharles VII§! has reclaimed Paris and many of the French lands. Charles has also been acknowledged as the rightful King by the Dukes of §YBurgundy§! in the treaty of Arras in 1435.\n\nHowever, the truce with England is tenuous. The English have still not relinquished their claims to the French throne, and one of the main demands of the new treaty, the surrender of §YMaine§! to France, has yet to materialize months later.\n\nWhile the Burgundians now passively support the French cause in the conflict with England, they are still a matter of concern for the French Crown. They have grown their domains far beyond the borders of France, into the Lowlands and the §YHoly Roman Empire§!. It is said that the Duke, who is also one of the richest men in Europe, harbors dreams of a future kingdom based around his collective domains.\n\nA united France would be one of the richest and most densely populated regions in Europe. If France could bring its many autonomous nobles to heel, and drive the English once and for all from the continent, it would be one of the most powerful states on the continent. Free to pursue voyages of exploration, an active foreign policy in Germany and the Low Countries or even an attack on the rich cities of Northern Italy, where the imperial influence has been waning for centuries."
 string_start_austria:0 "In 1438 the §YHabsburg§! dynasty had reached some of the most influential positions in Central Europe. Albert the Magnanimous was able able to claim not only the duchy of §YAustria§! but also the kingdoms of §YHungary§! and §YBohemia§! as well as the prestigious title ‘King-Elect of Germany’, reserved for those about to be made §YEmperors§! of the §YHoly Roman Empire§!. Misfortune struck however and Albert fell in battle against the Turks in 1439, leaving only his yet unborn son, Ladislaus the Posthumous, to succeed him.\n\nNewborn Ladislaus would have a hard time claiming his legacy, and lost the throne of Hungary after a short civil war to the §YPolish§! King Wladyslaw. The Kingdom of Bohemia on the other hand is still divided on the issue. Decades of religious civil wars have left the country ravaged with some parts still dominated by powerful Hussite nobles, heretics to the Catholic faith.\nOnly in Austria, the homeland of the Habsburg dynasty, has Ladislaus been accepted, though his uncle §YFrederick§! now rules as his regent.\n\nWith the catastrophe of Varna the Hungarian throne is again vacant, and Habsburg supporters remain hopeful that it can be reclaimed for Ladislaus. The powerful groups that deposed the boy king once do not seem disposed to accept him a second time. They may well let their dynamic Hungarian regent Janos Hunyadi lead them instead.\n\nThe dream of a Habsburg Emperor was not lost with Albert. Upon his death, Frederick, the Austrian regent, was elected to lead the Holy Roman Empire. As the first of his family to sit on the Imperial throne Frederick will leave a legacy for future Habsburgs. Should they choose to pursue his careful policies of diplomatic marriages and patient inheritance planning, the Habsburgs may well build up a position of power unlike that of any family among the kings of Europe. The responsibilities of Imperial rule are great obstacles in themselves. An Emperor must keep the peace in the empire, fight heresy such as the recent Hussites and at all costs protect Christianity from the advancing armies of the §YOttomans§!, a power to which the Habsburgs have already lost one King."
 string_start_castile:0 "Shaped in the battles of the Reconquista, the Crown of §YCastile§! is in fact not just one kingdom but a union of the kingdoms of Castile, León, Toledo, Galicia, Murcia, Jaén, Córdoba and Seville under the Castilian branch of the §YTrastámara§! dynasty. What remains of the Moorish presence in Iberia is now restricted to the southern kingdom of §YGranada§!, still a rich Muslim sultanate in many ways but also marred by infighting and the frequent border skirmishes with Christian raiders. Surrounded on all sides by Castilian castles it seems to be a matter of time before the Reconquista is brought to its logical conclusion and the kingdom is annexed.\n\nFor now however Castile has problems of its own. The Castilian Nobles and the local Cortes of the various constituent kingdoms still hold a large degree of power and many Trastámara kings have found themselves at the mercy of the estates of their kingdoms. Factions acting entirely out of their own interests have not shied away from supporting foreign pretenders from §YPortugal§! and §YAragon§! in the past.\n\nIf the kingdom can be united by a strong ruler, and the Reconquista completed, Castile will have a fearsome military force in its hands with a long tradition of fighting for the expansion of the Christian faith. While Castile lacks the seafaring tradition of neighboring Portugal they have just as good access to the Atlantic Ocean and the new trade routes that are opening up to the west and south-east."
 string_start_brandenburg:0 "The recent history of the March of §YBrandenburg§! has been a sad state of affairs. With poor soils, swamps and wild forests Brandenburg is not the richest lands of the §YHoly Roman Empire§! and under §YWittelsbach§! and §YLuxemburg§! rule the region has been been treated as a source of quick income. With the ascendence of the §YHohenzollern§! Dynasty things have slowly begun to change. Friedrich I spent his entire reign wearing down the influence of the Brandenburg estates and fighting the prevalent lawlessness, sending his armies against the castles of the many robber barons that have for long had a free reign over the region.\n\nIn many ways §YFriedrich II§!, ‘the Iron’, has proven to be his father’s son, resuming the policies intended to crush the power of local potentates and greedy burghers. He has also sent out feelers to the §YTeutonic Order§! for the reclamation of §YNeumark§!, a land originally part of Brandenburg, but pawned by his predecessors.\n\nThe difficulty in asserting state power is amply demonstrated by the Kalmar Union kingdoms of §YDenmark§!, §YSweden§! and §YNorway§!, were a king attempting to achieve similar goals was recently deposed and replaced by a Bavarian Wittelsbach. If Brandenburg is to be made a durable state it must also remain united, avoiding squabbles like those among the §YWettin§! heirs in Electoral §YSaxony§! to the south.\n\nThe nearby kingdoms of §YPoland§! and §YBohemia§! are both without rulers in 1444, one as a direct result of the failed Crusade of Varna against the Ottomans, and the other due to the rejection of the Habsburg heir Ladislaus the Posthumous by the Bohemian nobility. Despite the Bohemian lands still not having recovered from the Hussite wars of the last decades the Heretic Hussites remain a strong factor in Bohemian politics, making the kingdom a cause for concern among all its neighbors, Brandenburg included."
 string_start_burgundy:0 "The §YBourgogne§! branch of the §YValois§! dynasty not only rules the duchy of §YBurgundy§!, de jure a French possession, but also a significant part of the §YLow Countries§!, §YVermandois§! and the county of §YNevers§!. In short time they have created a realm that straddles some of the richest parts of §YFrance§! and the §YHoly Roman Empire§!. Taken together the dukes of Burgundy can command an enormous wealth. These economic resources have been used by §YPhilippe III§!, the Good, to expand the influence of his family even further, acquiring title after title along the Meuse and Rhine in an attempt to connect his realm.\n\nWhile France has spent the last century being torn asunder in the on-going fued between §YEnglish§! and French claimants to the French throne, Burgundy has grown to be the cultural and economic center of western Europe. Nowhere are the knightly ideals of the late middle ages as alive as in Burgundy, with great tournaments, grand feasts, and of course the Order of the Golden Fleece itself. A knightly order created by the Duke, aspiring to recreate the knighthood of the Arthurian legends or Greek myths. The Burgundian court also dominates fashion and art, with fortunes being spent on silk, paintings and fantastic illuminated manuscripts.\n\nThe Duchy of Burgundy already rival many kingdoms in influence, income and even military might. By playing off the English and French against eachother the Dukes have for a long time been practically independent. De jure however the Dukes remain both subjects to France and to the Holy Roman Empire. With the Hundred Years War nearing, what looks like, its conclusion, the future of the Duchy seems uncertain. If it continues its meteoric rise Burgundy could be the embryo of a new kingdom. A strong state in the middle of Western Europe. But the dukes have also gained many enemies in this short time. Should Philip and his successors play their cards right there may be a crown in their future, but that requires taking risks that might well cost them everything, potentially reducing their glorious domain to a footnote in the annals of history."

These are the famous §YJanissaries§!, who will in time grow into a powerful standing army. The Ottomans have come to power with the military backing of numerous marcher-lords, still highly autonomous on the Balkan frontier, while the administration lies in the hands of the Turkish aristocracy, literate in the ways of statecraft, but largely independent of the sultan’s authority.\n\nAll this is about to change. Having defeated the Crusader armies, the old sultan Murad II is now on his way back to his estates in Manisa, leaving the government in the hands of the young §YMehmed II§!. It is he who will go on to transform the Ottoman state into an empire, acquiring Constantinople as an imperial capital and establishing a centralized administration to rein in the marcher-lords and old Turkish families. For 'The Grand Turk', there can be no compromise – the House of Osman is to be the supreme authority in the land. The only question is this: where will his armies turn to first?"

It is however through the work of Afonso’s uncle, Dom Henrique, Henry the Navigator, that Portugal will leave its mark upon the world.\n\nUnder Henrique’s direction Portugal has made great leaps in shipbuilding and navigation, embarking on expeditions long past cape Bojador in the south.

As Afonso grows older however other forces at court will try to control him, hoping to use the young king for their own designs.\n\nWhile Castile has had a series of weak rulers and strong nobles, the Castilians can be a serious threat to the Portuguese.

Even the Christian empire of §YEthiopia§! must be attentive to the word of the Mamluk Sultan, as the Coptic pope, the ordainer of all Ethiopian bishops, is under Mamluk care.\n\nThe Mamluk amirs reproduce their ranks by purchasing new mamluks, foreign slaves mostly of Circassian origin. These slaves are then trained as soldiers or stewards, who all swear allegiance to their buyer, or ‘foster-father’. The amirs in turn put their household to use in the service of the sultans. When the time for succession comes it is in practice the will of these powerful men that determines which amir will become the next sultan. This system ensures that the sultanate is never short of elite warriors, so long as the route to import more slaves from the Black Sea lies open. However, as a governing system it has more than once lead to damaging conflicts and paralyzing factionalism.\n\nThe future looks bright for the Mamluk Sultanate however, as the death of Timur has removed the greatest threat in the region, with the once expansive §YTimurid§! Empire now reduced to a few bickering successor states in §YPersia§! and §YTransoxiana§!. The vacuum left by this empire in Anatolia, the Caucasus and Iraq has been filled by the §YQara Qoyunlu§! Federation in the east, and the resurgent §YOttoman§! Empire in the west. Both seem destined to come into conflict with the Mamluks in the near future.\n\nThe wealth of the sultanate is fed by the trade that flows through its Egyptian lands, bridging the distance between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. This places great demands on the Mamluk fleets to battle Christian pirates in the north as well as to protect the huge vulnerable vessels that follow the Hejaz coastline with coffee, cloth and spices through the Red Sea.\n\nAs [GetYear] draws to an end the Mamluk Sultanate is still the largest, richest and strongest state in the Middle East, it has many enemies but fears few of them."
 string_start_muscovy:0 "At the end of [GetYear] §YRussia§! is divided in a number of principalities, all of whom have for a long time lived in the shadow of the Tatar §YGolden Horde§!. The Tatars have been ever present in Russian politics, collecting tribute, taxes and acting as kingmakers in the Christian states. While the Grand Principality of Muscovy is not the oldest of these states it has recently grown to be the strongest. Located in the relatively fertily Opolye, Muscovy has a stronger internal economy than many other principalities. More importantly their princes has often acted as collectors for the Khans of the Golden Hordes. Making their princes both relatively safe and able to grow rich.\n\nSince the crushing defeat of the Golden Horde at the hands of the §YTimurid§! armies, their empire has fractured into a number of successor states. The core of their empire, the §YGreat Horde§! Is still a strong power in its own right, but it is fraught by internal struggles and has been unable to project much power over the Russians\n\nMuscovy has made good use of this power vacuum, expanding their control over the other principalities rapidly, through both cunning and use of military resources. Often even by simply buying out the poorer Princes and adding their lands to the Muscovite domain.\n\nMoscow is not the only strong state with interest in the Russian region, however, in the north the Republic of §YNovgorod§! has colonized much of the white sea coastline, securing the valuable waterways and a source of fur, the soft gold of the north and east.\n\nTo the west the Grand Duchy of §YLithuania§! and the Kingdom of §YPoland§! are doing what they can to assume the leadership of all Russias, asserting authority over most Ruthenian lands as well as a constant factor in the politics of the free Russian states in the north. Their interests are directly opposed to the growing power of Moscow, but their claim to the Rus legacy is quite dubious. If they can be overcome there is seemingly no limit to how much the Great Principality could grow.\n\nIf the Tatar Yoke could be crushed once and for all there is also the vast expanse of §YSiberia§!, full of untold riches, and dangers. If the many khanates, natives and the nature itself can be overcome then there is no limit to how rich a united Russian state could grow."

This way he secured the §YBagrationi§! dynasty's standing, but in practice it did not take long for this to accelerate the decline of the kingdom.\n\nAs the §YOttomans§! crush the crusaders of Varna, §YGeorgia§! is in all but name split between the powerful Bagrationi sons in §YImereti§! and §YTbilisi§!, and the autonomous Atabegs of §YSamtskhe§!."

A number of Aq Qoyunlu princes currently compete for the overlordship of the federation, while the Qara Qoyunlu, united under Jahan Shah have managed to lay claim to most of Timur’s legacy from Iraq to Azerbaijan.\n\nUnless the Aq Qoyunlu unite again under a strong leader they may well soon find themselves a client of the growing Qara Qoyunlu empire, invaded by the §YMamluk§!
