 byz_roman_empire_desc:0 "We are the true Roman Empire, created as a result of the west-east split and the only surviving remnant. The so-called 'Holy Roman Emperors' are none of those things and the pretenders to our rule in Constantinople are just that - foolish pretenders."

 BYZ_magna_graecia_title:0 "Відновлення Великої Греції"
 BYZ_magna_graecia_desc:0 "Magna Graecia, the territories settled by Greek Colonies in ancient times, have long been lost to the decline of our Empire. With competent leadership and a powerful navy, it is time to retake those territories and reinstate Roman government in the southern tip of Italy."
 BYZ_carthage_title:0 "Екзархат Африки"
 BYZ_carthage_desc:0 "The Roman Province of Africa has long been a core territory of the Roman Empire. Upon the Empire's division, it would in no less than a century fall under the rule of the Vandals. It would once again be brought to Roman Lands thanks to Justinian's ambitions. Then it would fall to the Caliphate in 7th century."
 BYZ_impending_doom_title:0 "Нависла мойра"
 BYZ_impending_doom_desc:0 "The Empire is at the brink of destruction. Every Roman citizen is silently aware that the end is nigh, and the days of Roman glory are already numbered. But is there really no hope for the crumbling empire? With the emperors struggling to make alliances with the west and seeking support, there might still be a chance for recovery."
 BYZ_bar_title:0 "Помста під Баром"
 BYZ_bar_desc:1 "The disastrous Battle of Bar ensured the Serbian realm was to remain independent from the Byzantine Empire for years to come. While we did manage to strike back at the Serbians since then, they were still able to take over much of our territory and did found the Serbian Empire. Since then, they have succumbed to decline of their own as well. Let us strike them while they are still down!"
 BYZ_illyria_title:0 "Просування до Ілліріка"

 BYZ_belisarius_foe_desc:0 "The war against Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy is one of the crowning achievements of Justinian's rule and proof of the military prowess of his general, Belisarius. The struggle against the Ostrogoths proved to be long and exhausting, but it was ultimately successful."
 BYZ_justinians_ambition_title:0 "Честолюбство Юстиніана"
 BYZ_justinians_ambition_desc:0 "The rule of Justinian, one of the most revered Eastern Roman Emperors, was one of glory and success. It is during his rule that the most successful attempt was made at bringing the Roman Empire back to a reality."
 BYZ_iberia_title:0 "Non Plus Ultra"
 BYZ_iberia_desc:0 "To the west lies the strait of Gibraltar, surrounded by the two Pillars of Hercules. The Romans of old believed that beyond Iberia there lies nothing.

Let our forces march and claim Hispania with its colonies as rightful Roman territory."
 BYZ_greece_title:0 "Обернути падіння"
 BYZ_greece_desc:0 "The Roman Empire has been consistently declining for about a millennium now. With small periods of recovery from time to time, today we may be lying at the definitive end of our journey.

While the Ottomans are still occupied, let us strike and bolster our hold in Greece - our most core territory."
 BYZ_bulgaria_title:0 "Відвоювати Болгарію"
 BYZ_bulgaria_desc:0 "While we may have succeeded in retaking Greece from Ottoman hold, the second fight may not be any better. Let us hope the Bulgarian nobles oppose their Muslim overlords more than our rule, exposing themselves to our influence once again."

 BYZ_aegean_islands_desc:0 "As our state expands and finds itself in a stronger position, the presence of the Latin Republics in our vicinity turns to be more of an impediment than support.

 BYZ_venetian_avarice_title:0 "Венеціанська скупість"
 BYZ_venetian_avarice_desc:0 "Constantinople fell victim to a siege by the Catholics in 1204. Sacked by Crusaders, who were initially intending to battle Muslims to the east, they would later betray their ideals and turn their attention towards our city and with the support from the treacherous Venetians, the megalopolis would fall to their combined forces in April of that accursed year. The capture would lead to a period of sacking when an innumerable amount of riches and priceless icons were stolen from the Queen of Cities. The Fall of Constantinople led to the establishment of Latin Empire, whose rule was called frankokratia. That period, albeit short, would accelerate the decline and further weaken the empire."
 BYZ_france_title:0 "За Альпами"
 BYZ_france_desc:0 "Beyond the Northern mountains of Italy lie the lands in Gallia, nowadays referred moreso as France, where the descendants of the Gauls and invading Germanic Tribes rule a powerful kingdom. Let us muster the forces from Italy and conquer that kingdom which is suffering from delusions of imperial ambitions."
 BYZ_france_ct:0 "Держава §Y[Root.GetName]§! отримає довічні претензії на всі провінції в §YБританії§!, §YНижніх країнах§! і §YЗахідній Німеччині§! необхідні для рішення §YВідновити Римську Імперію§!."
 BYZ_roman_empire_title:0 "Basileia Rhomaion"
 BYZ_roman_empire_desc:0 "It has been over a millennium since the two Roman Empires were still united. Split in 395, there were hopes that the act would help stop the decline of the Empire and its political system. Instead, the western half would fall in 476 and eastern half would almost fall to the Ottomans in 15th century. Nobody back then would have believed that the heirs of the Eastern monarchs would rule an Empire whole again. The proclamation of the restored Roman Empire is deserving of a great Triumph in Rome itself."
 BYZ_coast_title:0 "Мала Азія"
 BYZ_coast_desc:1 "Though already long conquered and settled by the Ottoman Turks, the western edges of Anatolia are still somewhat core territory of ours. With many Greeks living in the cities and in coastal towns, the reconquest of those territories could prove beneficial to strengthening our maritime commerce and general strength."
 BYZ_avenge_1071_title:0 "Помста за 1071"
 BYZ_avenge_1071_desc:0 "130 years prior to Fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders, the Roman Empire suffered a tragic defeat on the fields of Manzikert, sealing the fate of Roman Anatolia. Following this loss, Anatolia would come to be permanently settled by the Turks, fierce opponents, and rivals to our state. Having driven them out of Greece and Eastern Asia Minor, we should bring an end to their rule in the entirety of Anatolia."
 BYZ_syria_title:0 "Антіохія та Єрусалим"
 BYZ_syria_desc:0 "Syria is home to two of the Pentarchy seats. Settled since ancient times, home to Jesus Christ himself, we must take full control of the province and restore this important region back to the Roman Empire."
 BYZ_egypt_title:0 "В Єгипет"
 BYZ_egypt_desc:1 "Holding the Bishopric of Alexandria and the delta of the Nile, Egypt is critical to [Root.GetName] for more reasons than one. To take full control of this province should be our utmost priority and the rule over it is bound to bring us obscene wealth and power. We will unleash its potential and all those before us shall be treated as those who could not wield the true power the region provides."
 BYZ_breadbasket_title:0 "Житниця"
 BYZ_breadbasket_desc:0 "The Nile is the lifeline of the Egyptian civilization. Providing an outstanding supply of irrigation and therefore food, with this great river any civilization can grow in population. Having reconquered the area, let us exploit the Nile to its fullest."
 BYZ_pontic_empire_title:0 "Лазькі князі"
 BYZ_pontic_empire_desc:0 "Following the disastrous fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204, many minor splinters of the Empire have formed. One of them was the Komnenos realm formed in Pontus. Claiming to be the rightful heirs, they are mere pretenders destined to be destroyed. Their rule mostly extends over the Laz people. They are no emperors, but mere princes!"
 BYZ_persians_title:0 "Принизити персів"
 BYZ_persians_desc:0 "The Roman Empire has a history of centuries full of feuds with the Persians over supremacy in Mesopotamia and Caucasia. Let us move in and deal a decisive blow to their ambitions and pride, forever thwarting their plans for lands west of the Zagros Mountains. They need to be humiliated!"
 BYZ_mesopotamia_title:0 "Слідуйте за річками"
 BYZ_mesopotamia_desc:0 "One of the cradles of civilization that is Mesopotamia is surrounded by strong enemies and lacks natural barriers. Let us ensure that it is no other great power's playground but ours. Persians shall have no say in those matters!"
 BYZ_mecca_title:0 "Серце ісламу"
 BYZ_mecca_desc:0 "Mecca is the center point for the Muslim Community. Home to the first Caliphate that has taken vast swathes of territories from our crumbling empire, it would be most ironic for us to seize their most holy of cities. Even more ironic it would be to convert it to a church."
 BYZ_economic_independence_title:0 "Економічна незалежність"
 BYZ_economic_independence_desc:0 "After 1204, the successive Emperors tried to make Byzantine markets into an invaluable asset of the Latin merchants, granting them various privileges and excluding them from the kommerkion - 10% customs tax on goods arriving in Constantinople. This had the disastrous effect of destroying our merchants' trust and letting them be outcompeted. Let us reclaim those markets."
 BYZ_return_to_gold_title:0 "Повернутись до золота"
 BYZ_return_to_gold_desc:0 "In the past, the Східна Римська Імперія would commit to minting gold coins for the subject. However, with loss of gold and silver mines, it would become increasingly difficult to strike such coins. The last gold coin to be struck was hyperperon, and even it would succumb to the usual fate of being debased to support military campaigns."
 BYZ_support_weavers_title:0 "Підтримка ткачів"
 BYZ_support_weavers_desc:0 "Silk-weaving has a relatively long history in Byzantium. With the smuggling of silkworms in sixth century, the art of sericulture has persisted for a millennium and various guilds of weavers have formed in larger cities. Let us support them and provide them with markets for their goods."
 BYZ_tarnished_state_title:0 "Змарніла держава"
 BYZ_tarnished_state_desc:0 "Our state has become tarnished by war and depopulation. Constant civil wars and conflicts have depleted our most invaluable asset - population. Let our lands be devastated no more and let the vacant homes not be empty any longer."
 BYZ_book_of_the_eparch_title:0 "Книга префекта"
 BYZ_book_of_the_eparch_desc:0 "With a growing number of merchants in the Queen of all cities, let us create new manuals and records to keep track of the local burghers. With so many guilds and exceptions, it is imperative the future eparchs have the experience to deal with them."
 BYZ_at_least_10_production_income:0 "Щонайменше §Y10.0§!¤ щомісячного доходу від §Yвиробництва§!."
 BYZ_glass_ware_title:0 "Скляні вироби Візантії"
 BYZ_glass_ware_desc:0 "The glassmaking of the eastern romans has been nothing short of incredible. Famous across Europe along with the imperial silks, it would influence the Venetian Crystal and give rise to many other styles in the process. But since the Latin merchants have taken over our markets, this art seems to have been lost to time, only remaining significant in Constantinople. Let us rectify that."
 BYZ_city_of_worlds_desire_title:0 "Найжаданіше місто у світі"
 BYZ_city_of_worlds_desire_desc:0 "Constantinople, the seat of Eastern Roman Empire, bears many names and nicknames. From Byzantium through New Rome, all the way to 'Queen of Cities', the most fitting nickname will always remain to be 'The City of World's Desire', which perfectly exemplifies the envy of the surrounding states."
 BYZ_megalopolis_title:0 "Мегалополіс"
 BYZ_megalopolis_desc:0 "The Byzantine Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."
 BYZ_royal_purple_title:0 "Королівський пурпур"
 BYZ_royal_purple_desc:0 "Yet the most iconic of all Byzantine symbols has to be the Королівський пурпур dye. Tyrian Purple garments were the symbol of royalty and royal offspring would be born in a room glazed with purple rock, exceedingly rare at the time. The dye would be produced in several spots across the Empire, but the yields were never high, and availability remained limited. Let us restore the color to the Roman royalty."
 BYZ_promote_the_merchants_title:0 "Сприяти [Root.BurghersDV]"
 BYZ_promote_the_merchants_desc:0 "With our betrayal that we have inflicted upon our [Root.GetBurghersName], the trust between them and the state has become seriously strained. Let us rectify the mistakes of old and give them hope in our rule."
 BYZ_collect_our_profits_title:0 "Зібрати наш прибуток"
 BYZ_collect_our_profits_desc:0 "With our support of the merchants and loans provided to the manufacturers, it is high time we collected the interest on them. We reap what we sow, and we are about to feast on the fruits of our labor."
 BYZ_warehouse_of_the_east_title:0 "Склад сходу"
 BYZ_warehouse_of_the_east_desc:0 "With our support of manufacturers and the massive growth of cities and guilds, we have risen to a rank of manufacturing Entrepôt. With many prized goods originating right here, the Romans aren't just famous for their long and rich history, but also for the beauty of their fabrics that remains affordable to all."
 BYZ_peloponesian_renaissance_title:0 "Пелопоннеський Ренесанс"
 BYZ_peloponesian_renaissance_desc:0 "While Constantinople was in imminent danger of an invasion, a fraction of the Byzantine scholars has made Morea their home, giving the peninsula a true rebirth. Originating from Peloponnese was Gemistos Plethon, a philosopher who studied the works of Plato and had deep connections to the old beliefs."
 BYZ_monemvasian_merchants_title:0 "Монемвасійські купці"
 BYZ_monemvasian_merchants_desc:0 "Monemvasia is a town off the eastern coast of Peloponnese. Situated in a unique position, the site became a local trade center, giving rise to several merchant families, among them the Notaras."
 BYZ_thessaly_title:0 "Торгівля в Салоніках"
 BYZ_thessaly_desc:0 "Thessaloniki would for a long time remain the secondary capital for the empire, fulfilling both political and maritime functions. Let us restore the city to its former glories!"
 BYZ_wealth_from_the_east_title:0 "Багатства зі Сходу"
 BYZ_wealth_from_the_east_desc:0 "As the Empire expands to its old territories, the old trade routes become lively again. We have focused on bringing our core territories to their former selves, but we should do the same to the rest of the former empire! The wealth of the east should once again flow to Constantinople forevermore."
 BYZ_church_in_distress_title:0 "Церква в біді"
 BYZ_church_in_distress_desc:1 "The rightful Church is in distress. Greatly anxious regarding the monarch's decision to enter a union with Rome, the clergy is highly upset, with many priests downright defying the emperor. The faith in the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty must be restored."
 BYZ_muscovite_autocephaly_title:0 "Приборкати московитьку автокефалію"
 BYZ_muscovite_autocephaly_desc:0 "Після декларації щодо об'єднання церков багато єпископів в інших державах вирішили розірвати свої стосунки з нами, натомість вирішивши проголосити автокефалію та незалежність від патріарха в Константинополі. Серед них були беззаперечні лідери цього руху з Московії. Змусьмо їх повернути назад у кошари."
 BYZ_mend_the_schism_title:0 "Залагодити схізм"
 BYZ_mend_the_schism_desc:0 "As a result of conflicts between the Roman supremacy and our rightful belief in equal rights, the supporters of Rome have severed their ties, causing a schism in the church in 1054. With excommunications placed on each other, both churches remain separate to this day. Only our force may rectify that."
 BYZ_church_authority_title:0 "Повернути авторитет"
 BYZ_church_authority_desc:0 "While we have curbed the anxiety of our priests, the average citizen's belief in the Monarch and Church has plummeted. We need to reassure the population who has been divinely chosen to lead them and this wave of impiety must be stopped."
 BYZ_new_synods_title:0 "Нові синоди"
 BYZ_new_synods_desc:0 "In the few centuries following Jesus' lifetime, the religious community of bishops has gathered in many Synods to discuss the faith in depth. With the evolution of the world, culture and changes in the socioeconomic sphere, it might be worthwhile to continue this tradition."
 BYZ_pentarchy_title:0 "Відновити Пентархію"
 BYZ_pentarchy_desc:0 "Before the collapse of our Empire, the five Patriarchs in Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome and Constantinople used to live in relative peace and unity, convening on matters when necessary and serving our ecclesiastical community. Let's bring the golden age back."
 BYZ_reinforce_constantinople_title:0 "Посилити Константинополь"
 BYZ_reinforce_constantinople_desc:0 "The mighty Theodosian Walls are in disrepair and the Ottoman threat in looming. We need to take action, lest we see our walls crumble like brittle glass."
 BYZ_defence_in_depth_title:0 "Defense in Depth"
 BYZ_defence_in_depth_desc:0 "If we want to hold an impenetrable defense, relying on just one aspect is not going to be enough of an assurance. We need multiple sets of walls and multiple plans in order to be prepared for any knavish trick our foes might have prepared."
 BYZ_hexamilion_title:0 "Стіна Гексаміліона"
 BYZ_hexamilion_desc:0 "The Hexamilion wall used to protect the isthmus in ancient times. Recently, the wall has been repaired to protect against the Ottomans, but that has failed too. We must either commit or give up on it."
 BYZ_theme_system_title:0 "Система фем"
 BYZ_theme_system_desc:0 "Система фем used to be our form of civilian and military governance. Due to the sudden decline in territory, the need for themes has been rendered non-existent. Let us restore this system for good."
 BYZ_restore_navy_title:0 "Відновити візантійський флот"
 BYZ_restore_navy_desc:0 "The fall of importance of Dromon, supremacy of the Latin Galea, and our dependence on the Latin Republics for naval support has led to our fleet being essentially nought. With our shackles thrown, let us once again arm ourselves on the seas."
 BYZ_greek_fire_title:0 "Морський вогонь"
 BYZ_greek_fire_desc:0 "The Greek Fire, known under many names by the Greeks, was among the most important innovations aiding the Східна Римська Імперія. It is the name for a substance that was discharged onto enemy ships and lit on fire, serving as an early flamethrower. This gave the Byzantine navy a significant edge over its maritime rivals, until the practice ceased when the sources of its ingredients were lost."
 BYZ_branching_bottom_title:0 "Галужена місія"

 BYZ_foreign_officers_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Foreign Officers[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_foreign_officers_desc:0 "The general lack of manpower and skilled generals is evident. While not beneficial to the general state of the army, hiring foreign officers and their companies could bolster our reserves and staff."
 BYZ_decentralized_pronoia_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Pronoia Rights[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_decentralized_pronoia_desc:0 "The Pronoiars are mostly hereditary landholders who have been rewarded for their loyal military service. Perhaps the system could see amendments to improve their capabilities, perhaps mimicking the Ottoman Timars."
 BYZ_strategoi_realms_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Realms of the Strategoi[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_strategoi_realms_desc:0 "Through our choices the army has evolved into a decentralized collection of native and foreign generals, holding mostly hereditary tracts of land, where they recruit from the local population and give lands to their most loyal soldiers."
 BYZ_centralized_pronoia_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Control over the Pronoiars[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_centralized_pronoia_desc:0 "Pronoiars are mostly landowners whose land has been granted for military service. Initially non-inheritable, the posts would later become hereditary as being a pronoiar was no longer that special. This institution is of great service to our military, but it does require immediate reform."
 BYZ_reform_the_themata_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Reform the Themata[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_reform_the_themata_desc:0 "While Система фем functions, it is woefully outdated to modern needs. We need to reform it to better suit the future - an age of gunpowder and standing armies."
 BYZ_varangian_guard_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Варязька гвардія[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_varangian_guard_desc:0 "Варязька гвардія була елітним підрозділом в нашому війську. Initially comprised of Viking mercenaries, it would later be reinforced by Anglo-Saxons. The unit would get integrated into the greater society and would cease to exist as a separate regiment. Many were claiming to be Varangians in the 1400s. It is time to restore this famous unit and modernize it."

Due to their delusions of independence, we had to fight many wars to keep them down and it took them many struggles to eventually split off from the realm. With the rise of the Serbian Empire, the country would become a decisive player, though they too, have been touched with cold grip of wither.

Today, those territories are once again held by a Hellenic government, giving reassurances to the local population that their identity and rich history will be preserved under this new rule.

But there can only be one successor to Belisarius, the primary general of Emperor Justinian, whose skillful command has allowed him to temporarily claim the mantle of Rome and to bring the shattered Roman world together. There are four primary candidates for this post; a learned student of the strategikon, a brave, inspiring leader, an excellent siege specialist and a man professing brilliant strategic thinking."

It cannot be said the city was left unmaintained, but it certainly has not seen the desired growth. As of today, the city once again lies in Roman hands, but the population does not consider themselves Roman. But with how grandiose our army's crossing into Rome was, the die has been cast and we shall sooner falter than to let Italy go."

Unfortunately, as the Empire began to decline, so did its ability to set the standards for foreign fashion. Worse yet, foreign clothes and silks have actually eclipsed the prestige of the Roman ones in decades leading up to 15th century.

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.39.d:0 "Constantine, one of the Despots of Morea at the time, has decided to join forces with Western support and to move against Ottomans in Thessaly. While ultimately a failure, it would give Constantine invaluable experience in war and would raise the morale of his forces."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.48.d:0 "Since the Eastern and the Western Churches split in 1054, it seemed like there was no unity in sight and there wouldn't be for centuries to come. It almost seemed like the two churches would get reunited in the fifteenth century thanks to the terrible situation the Roman Empire found itself in, but it was able to return to grace, throwing off the shackles of Papal influence.

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.51.d:0 "In 1439, Ioannes travelled to Florence alongside many orthodox religious scholars to discuss the matters of mending the schism with the Pope. With mounting pressure from the Monarch determined to earn support of the Pope and his subordinates, the Byzantines agreed to formally unite the two churches and to accept the superiority of the Pope. This move, while seemingly necessary, would cause the rise of the anti-unionist faction in Constantinople, sparking wide unrest in the last days of the city."

With each passing day, the grip of the crown slackens, its shine dulled by the tarnish of political failure and burgeoning chaos. Rumors from the west carry news of Demetrius rallying his nobles, their words seething with discontent and ambitious yearnings. His claims to the crown grow louder and more audacious, stoking the fires of an imminent conflict. Other nobles, once staunch supporters of the crown, now whisper of rebellion, their loyalty swaying in the face of uncertainty. It seems the feared crisis is upon us. With our kingdom fractured and at the precipice of civil war, we find ourselves in desperate need of decisive action. Will we regain control, or will we let the crown slip from our grasp?"

This daring move is a chilling example of the damage our internal strife has wrought. The separatists see the weakened state of our kingdom as an opportunity to establish their rule, free from the burdens and controls of the central authority.

His call for independence reverberates through the realm, sowing discord and inspiring other would-be separatists.

The prosperous era came to an abrupt end with the onslaught of the Mongols, Turks, and Timur, paving the way for a relentless fight for survival. This dwindling power was accompanied by an economic decline, leading to a desperate nobility demanding an increasing number of privileges.\n\nIn an attempt to address this issue, King Alexander I, following a time-honored Byzantine tradition, appointed his three sons as joint rulers, establishing a unique system known as a triarchy where the sons shared sovereignty over the kingdom. This arrangement, however, was short-lived as Alexander renounced his throne in 1442 and sequestered himself in a monastery.\n\nHis eldest son, Vakhtang, claimed the throne, yet with no successor to his name, the nobility and his brothers are biding their time, eagerly anticipating a chance to claim the crown for themselves. Hence, the future trajectory of our kingdom remains shrouded in uncertainty."

The Georgian Reconquest envisions a triumphant return to Constantinople, a rebirth of a new Roman era, with a Georgian ruler ascending the throne, guided by the principles of righteousness, strength, and unwavering faith. In this momentous event, Georgia, fortified by its indomitable spirit and military prowess, shall become the bulwark of the Orthodox world. The new Roman legacy, shaped by Georgian hands, will rekindle the flame of Byzantine glory and breathe new life into the Orthodox faith. The walls of Constantinople, now under Georgian guardianship, shall defy the onslaught of adversaries, becoming an impregnable bastion that inspires hope and preserves the Orthodox legacy for generations to come.

He installed himself as the Emir of Baghdad, and while he is still officially a subject of Jahan Shah, a member of our ruling dynasty with such a powerful base of operations could prove hazardous.

Amongst them, the Seljuk dynasty shone as a beacon of greatness, governing with wisdom and valor. Centuries later, fate has bestowed upon us the opportunity to reclaim the legacy of our esteemed predecessors and unite the fragmented lands of Iran under our rule. For far too long, the usurpers of the Timurid dynasty have plagued these lands, sowing discord and chaos. But we, the rightful successors of the Seljuk bloodline, have risen to the occasion and dethroned these interlopers. Now, with Iran under our dominion, we are tasked with the responsibility of revitalizing a land ravaged by Mongol and Timurid raids, which have left Iran in a state of depopulation and internal division.

Guided by the genius of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, an esteemed polymath and astronomer, the observatory became a haven for scholars from far and wide. However, the ravages of time and the ebb and flow of empires conspired to cast a shadow over this beacon of knowledge. Neglect and conflict marred its once-majestic halls, leaving it a mere shadow of its former glory. But fret not, for our enlightened reign shall herald a renaissance for the Maragheh Observatory. Under our guidance, the observatory will be meticulously restored to its former grandeur. Walls once worn by centuries of neglect shall be repaired, and the celestial instruments that once guided the gaze of scholars shall be revived. A select group of astronomers, mathematicians, and cartographers will be invited from across our realm to revive the spirit of inquiry that once thrived within these walls. The restored Maragheh Observatory shall serve as a center of astronomical research and intellectual discourse, attracting brilliant minds from far and wide. Our kingdom will bask in the glory of their discoveries, as they unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and illuminate the darkest corners of the night sky.

The region, ripe with wealth and brimming with strategic importance, is now to be passed on to his son, Fulad Mirza, in accordance with local customs and traditions. Yet, our sovereign Jahan Shah has grand visions of a centralized realm, a singular, powerful entity united under his command. The existence of a semi-autonomous Emirate in the heart of his dominions, especially one as influential as Baghdad, could prove a thorn in his side, an unwelcome obstacle to his aspirations.\n\nTo deal with this delicate matter, we now have to make a crucial decision. We could choose to douse the embers of local rule by force, abolishing the Emirate of Baghdad, and integrating it directly into the heart of our realm. This would undoubtedly strengthen our central power, but it may also provoke the ire of other local lords and risk internal strife. Alternatively, we might seek a more peaceful route, finding diplomatic or familial ties to slowly draw the Emirate closer to our own domain without risking open conflict. This choice may buy us time and avoid immediate unrest, but leaves the question if a stable and loyal realm can be achieved without a show of force.

His rise demonstrated the potential for local leadership to thrive even in challenging circumstances, offering a glimmer of hope and stability during an era of uncertainty.

 flavor_mam.108.t:0 "The Many Capitals of the Ethiopians"
 flavor_mam.108.d:0 "The people of Ethiopia, despite being under our firm administration, are known to move their centers around.

Majestic domes and intricate tilework adorn the landscape, as the rulers of the persian people craft a unique architectural identity that melds their illustrious heritage with innovative designs. The dazzling turquoise and cobalt hues of Isfahan's Imam Mosque's mosaic tiles reflect a profound commitment to aesthetics. The Ali Qapu Palace rises in grandeur, its intricate calligraphy and delicate stucco work reflecting a society that cherishes the fusion of art and architecture. Amidst these structures, their royal line not only construct buildings but weave a narrative of cultural legacy, where architecture becomes a canvas upon which the empire's brilliance is etched for posterity."
